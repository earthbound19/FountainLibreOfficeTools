   	EXT. MALL-- DAY
 
A PROPHET, white, twenty-five, wiry, and frantic, quickly climbs from a sidewalk to stand up on a chair, at a table where THREE MEN, all of them somewhat punk-styled, sit and eat.
 
       PROPHET      
The end is *near!*
  	
		MAN NUMBER ONE
	  Um, shut up?				   

				UNECESSARY SHOT DIRECTIVE:     
	 	 	 	 	 
Do a high shot looking down on the men from the Prophet's point of view.
                                              
MAN NUMBER ONE
Um, shut up?
										
PROPHET	(o.s)
	It's *closer* now!		  
   			
The man throws his drink cup at the . . . prophet, and the prophet tries to dodge, but it hits him with a splatter.

EXT. EARTH--DAY

Earth explodes.

INT. BORING PLACE--DAY


  Then some stuff happens in *italics*. And _*underlined italics*_.
Then **bold**. Then _**underlined bold**_. 
Then ***bold italics***. Then _***underlined bold italics***_.		
	
_Then an underscored	 line was--interspersed with an *italicized phrase*, just for the sake of formatting nightmares_.
 
			 
			CHARACTER (V.O. )
		(parenthetically)
	Then a character says something in voice-over. He then -- says something something other something- until this is long...enough to (what?--a parenthesis--in the-middle of dialogue) go on...two lines...at least and probably many more and the audience no longer wants to hear--him, if they ever did.	





	INT. BORING PLACE--DAY  			




CHARACTER (O. S. )
(parenthetically yet again)
This is a (parenthetical)...remark.

				CHARACTER (V.O.)
			(and still, this is guy loves parentheticalsis!)
		This is yet another, useless, paranthetical remark.
    	
Then the screenplay ends.
