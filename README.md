FountainLibreOfficeTools
========================

Fountain Tools for LibreOffice is a freeware toolset to easily create professionally formatted screenplays "from scratch," sourced from platform-independent and future-proof fountain text files (or, a subset of fountain), including proper handling of elements that span pages (no widows or orphans--it's a layout thing), and formatting which so closely mimics the better "bang for your buck" layout of Movie Magic Screenwriter that no reader will be the wiser.
